> Permature optimization is the root of all evil (Sir Tony Hoare)

- no need to optimize here anything yet
- but since we are using redux
- most components could be optimzed by
- - React.memo
- - callbacks by useCallback
- selectors with comparators

* Signle "container" component - other components are purely presentational
